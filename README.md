## Technical description

We decided to use NodeJs as backend, so it handles the API, and as a frontend we decided to use Angular 7.

To start using the application you have to download node: https://nodejs.org/it/
Once you have done installing node you have to run npm install.
To start the frontend go to the folder front-end and run: ng serve -o 
To start the backend go to the folder backend and run: node index.js

Once you have done that you'll be able to use GavPass.
